# FullTeamSelect
a tool to track 10v10 in Fantasy Strike


You can build the solution yourself or use the exe in FullTeamSelect/FullTeamSelect/FullTeamSelect/bin/Release/FullTeamSelect.exe

#Using the tool
Press Start, each side is given a character to choose. Play out the round as normal and then press the winner button for whichever side won.

Play will continue until one side has won with every single character just like in a normal team battle. (you should have 'no character' if you won).
